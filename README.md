# 📊 Churnlytics: A Telco Churn Analytics Project

**Churnlytics** is a complete end-to-end project that explores customer churn behavior in the telecom sector using Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Power BI.  
It combines exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, business insights, and a dashboard to help identify at-risk customers and reduce revenue loss.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Analyze churn behavior using Python & statistics
- Build classification models to predict churn
- Extract SQL-based business insights from structured data
- Create a dynamic Power BI dashboard for decision-makers
- Estimate potential revenue loss from churned customers

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- **SQL** (MySQL for business queries)
- **Power BI** (KPI cards, visual dashboards)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for EDA and modeling
- **GitHub** for version control & project hosting

## 📈 Key Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 80.4%    | 0.65      | 0.57   | 0.61     |

## 📌 Power BI Dashboard

- 📊 Churn rate % card
- 📉 Monthly Charges by Churn
- 🔍 Tenure vs Churn
- 🍩 Donut chart of PaymentMethod by Churn
- 📶 InternetService vs Churn column chart

---

## 📚 Business Insights (SQL)

Here are a few highlights from SQL analysis:

- 📉 Overall churn rate is approximately **26%**
- 📦 Customers with **month-to-month contracts** churn significantly more
- 💸 **High monthly charges** are associated with higher churn risk
- 👥 **New customers** (low tenure) churn more frequently
- 💰 Estimated revenue loss due to churn is significant

> Find all SQL queries and insights in [`Customer_Churn.sql`](Customer_Churn.sql)

---

## 🧪 Statistical Analysis

- T-tests used to compare `MonthlyCharges` of churned vs non-churned customers
- Chi-square tests for contract type vs churn

---

## 🧠 Learnings & Impact

- Built full-stack DS project from raw data to ML to dashboard
- Practiced data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation
- Generated actionable insights using SQL and visuals
- Strengthened storytelling with data using Power BI
